- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DanaLenz, a computer science student at the RWTH university in Aachen, Germany.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in C++ development, automated reasoning, knowledge representation, formal logics and related topics in AI.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a little program for automated, preference based task scheduling (for a singular human person) based on existing OMT solvers.
- :exclamation: I often work via my university account, so the contribution statistics do not represent the actual amount of work I do. Both the scheduler and omtsched project are my own, with me currently being the only contributor.
